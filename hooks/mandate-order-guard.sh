# mandate-order-guard.sh — PreToolUse guard for the Agentic Trading Desk Mandate.
#
# Enforces, deterministically, the order-type rule the Mandate states in prose but
# cannot itself enforce. The rule (set by Eli 2026-08-26) is clock-dependent:
#
#   Regular hours (Mon-Fri 09:30-15:58 ET) -> type=market. dollar_amount allowed.
#   Outside regular hours                  -> type=limit with an explicit
#                                             limit_price, sized in SHARES.
#                                             dollar_amount forbidden, because the
#                                             Robinhood MCP only accepts it with
#                                             type=market and would silently turn a
#                                             priced order into an unattended
#                                             market fill hours later.
#   Always                                 -> stop_market / stop_limit denied,
#                                             time_in_force must be gfd,
#                                             notional <= $100.
#
# The clock split is the whole point: market orders fire only while the book is
# deep and the session is live; everything else stays priced.
#
# Holidays: this guard cannot know the market calendar. A market order on a
# weekday holiday passes the clock check and is queued by the broker.
# time_in_force=gfd is the backstop — it expires rather than filling into an
# open nobody evaluated.
#
# Install: PreToolUse hook, matcher "mcp__Robinhood__place_equity_order".
# Wired by .claude/settings.json in this skill; scripts/session-setup.sh installs jq
# and smoke-tests both branches of this guard on every session boot.
